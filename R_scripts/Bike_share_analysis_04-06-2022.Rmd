## Business Task: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bike differently?

**Scope of this analysis:**

To find patterns and trends in the data which could provide meaningful insight to the marketing. The insights gained from this analysis will be used by the marketing team to design a campaign that could target casual members to become annual members.

-   Casual riders: Customers who purchase *daily-pass* or *single-ride*.
-   Annual members: Customers who pay to use the service annually.

### Data:

**Source:** Publicly made available by Motivate International Inc. [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), under [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

**Organization:** There are 12 data sets in csv format. Each data set represents one month of data from 01/2021 to 12/2021.

We merged the 12 data sets into a single dataframe using python. The data cleaning and modelling was performed in VScode Jupyter notebook using python.

In this R-notebook, we will analyse the data to find trends and patterns.

Loading all dependencies:

```{r Loading Dependencies, include=FALSE}
# loading dependicies required for the analysis
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate) 
require(scales)
library(ggridges)
library(treemap)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(data.table)
  
```

After loading the dependencies we load the data on to a dataframe called `master_data`.

This is the data that has already been cleaned using python and stored the cleaned data as a csv file. Using `glimpse()` function to get an insight of the dataframe we just imported.

```{r Loading master_data}
#using read.csv to read the csv file and storing it in vector named master_data
master_data <- fread("/Users/locco/Desktop/Google_Analytics_Course/Case_Studies/Bike_share_Data/merged_data.csv")

#glimpse of the dataset
glimpse(master_data)

#glimpse() provides a horizontal view of the dataframe. Beginning with the Number of rows and columns, followed by column name trailing '$' symbol, <data_type> and data....... 
```

There are 14 variables/columns (as seen above). For this analysis we will be working with mainly ride_id, started_at, rideable_type, membership_type,total_seconds, distance_miles.

Filtering out columns that we wont be using for analysis and storing it into a new vector called `trimmed_df`

```{r Filtering and renaming columns}
trimmed_df <- master_data %>%
  select(ride_id, started_at, bike_type, membership_type,duration_seconds, duration_minutes, distance_miles)

# checking if the desired funtions above were performed
glimpse(trimmed_df)
```

Now that we have chosen the data we want, we can play around with the data and explore it, gain some insights and find some patterns.

Performing descriptive analytics by comparing annual and casual members based on the following questions:

- Compare number of rides by year. (Summary and Viz)
- Compare number of rides by month. (Summary and Viz)
- Compare number of rides by weekday. (Summary and Viz)
- Compare average minutes by year. (Summary and Viz)
- Compare average minutes by months. (Summary and Viz)
- Compare average minutes by weekday. (Summary and Viz)
- Compare types of bikes used by each members. (decide viz)
- ( `Type of ride by week and month ?`)

Lets answer the question as they appear in the list.

```{r}
#number of riders by year summary

summary_df <- trimmed_df %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(started_at, abbr= FALSE, label= TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(weekday = lubridate::wday(started_at, abbr = FALSE, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(membership_type, month, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(),average_minutes = mean(duration_minutes))
  
View(summary_df)
```


```{r}
#number of rides in a year viz
summary_df %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = membership_type, y = number_of_rides, color = membership_type, fill = membership_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)

  
```



```{r}
#number of rides by month Viz
summary_df %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = month, y = number_of_rides, color = membership_type, fill = membership_type)) +
  geom_col(position =  "dodge") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+ 
  #coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5)) + facet_grid(~membership_type)
```



```{r}
# Number of rides by weekdays Viz
summary_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, color = membership_type, fill = membership_type)) +
  geom_col(position =  "dodge") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + facet_grid(~membership_type) + 
 # coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5))

```


```{r}
#Ride in average minutes by year viz
summary_df %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = membership_type, y = average_minutes, fill = membership_type)) +
  geom_col(position =  "dodge") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5))
```


```{r}
# Ride in average minutes by month viz
summary_df %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = month, y = average_minutes, fill = membership_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + facet_grid(~membership_type) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5))
```


```{r}
# Ride in average minutes by weekday viz

summary_df %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weekday, y = average_minutes, fill = membership_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + facet_grid(~membership_type) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5))

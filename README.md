***Disclaimer: Cyclistics is a fictional company based on a real conpany called Divvy in Chicago.***

### **Introdruction**:
    
Cyclistics is a bike sharing conpany providing service in Chicago area. Featuring more than 5800 bikes of four different kinds and over 600 docking stations.

Customers can use the bikes by purchasing a day-pass or per-use or purchase annual memberships.

Financial analysts at Cyclistics have suggested that annual members are more profitable than casual members. Annual members are key to future growth of the company.

Therefore, they want to target current casual members to convert them into annual members, instead of targeting new audience.
 
### **Scope of Analysis**:

How annual members and casual members used Cyclistics differently in 2021?
